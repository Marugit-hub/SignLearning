# SignLearning

## Overview

The Interactive Sign Learning Platform is a computer vision-based project designed to recognize and analyze hand signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This platform offers a unique and interactive way to learn and practice sign language.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Hand Sign Detection:** The system can detect and track hand signs in real-time using computer vision techniques.

- **CNN Model:** A trained CNN model is used for accurate hand sign recognition.

- **Learning Modules:** Users can access learning modules to practice and learn sign language in an interactive way.

- **Webcam Integration:** The platform uses the webcam for capturing hand signs, making it accessible through a web interface.

- **Responsive Design:** The system is designed to work on a variety of devices, making it convenient for users.

## Usage

To use this platform:
1. Start the webcam using the provided functionality.
2. Display your hand sign to the webcam.
3. The system will recognize and display the sign on the interface.

## Installation

To install and run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in a code editor or IDE.
3. Install any necessary dependencies.
4. Run the project on a local server.
